VERIFICATION: 	It answers the question "Are we building it right?" refering to ensure that the
	      	program implements certain functions or tasks

VALIDATION:	It asnwers the question "Are we building the correct product?". Ensures that the
		software in matter is built according to the customer needs

The difference between both is that VERIFICATION deals with more specific aspects/functions 
of the software that is being built, while VALIDATION ensure the whole software together meets
what the customer is specting.
